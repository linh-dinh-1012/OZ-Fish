# 🐟 OZ-Fish: Fish Image Classification App

## 🌍 Overview  
This project was developed during the Le Wagon bootcamp (2023). Its goal is to classify fish species from images, aiming to support marine biodiversity research and conservation efforts through automated visual recognition.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) for object detection  
- TensorFlow & Scikit-learn for training and evaluation  
- Streamlit for building a simple web interface  
- Python, OpenCV for data preprocessing and handling

## 🎯 My Contributions  
- Prepared and cleaned the image dataset (including annotations)  
- Trained and fine-tuned a YOLO model to recognize multiple fish species  
- Built and deployed a working prototype using Streamlit

## 🚀 Outcome  
- **Live app**: [ozfish.streamlit.app](https://ozfish.streamlit.app/)  
- **Source code**: [github.com/Pippow/OZ-Fish](https://github.com/Pippow/OZ-Fish)
